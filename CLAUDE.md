=== Process ===

* Use cargo run --bin rather than doing it in two steps with cargo build
* Commit after work items when they are clearly definitely done. For fixes, if it's not obvious it's best to ask the user to test and to let them know you're ready to commit, creating the cognitive punctuation that converts into flow.

=== Training ===

* Set the timeout very high (infinite, hours, etc.) it's futile to try and line it up.

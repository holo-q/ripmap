Analyze trajectory state:
- Improving: continue direction
- Degrading: revert or reverse
- Plateaued: orthogonal move

Analyze failures:
- Missing signal vs overwhelming signal
- Parameter interactions

Distinguish between 'signal loss' (ranker too strict) and 'noise injection' (ranker too loose). If 'depth' failures persist, distinguish 'unreachable' from 'undervalued'. If targets are missing (unreachable/fragmented), evaluate increasing global graph connectivity (alpha/teleport) *cautiously*, prioritizing `focus` expansion to recover deep signals without indiscriminately increasing distractor noise."""

- NDCG drop >5% = collapse signal
- Temporal and structural signals compete
- High boosts cause tunnel vision
- Low alpha localizes, high alpha globalizes
- Standard depth penalties punish modular architecture (e.g. `crates/`); use `focus` expansion to recover deep signals instead of just flattening global depth.

Over-correction into 'localization' causes 'depth' failures by fragmenting the graph. Distractors are better managed by specific demotions or type-based filtering, not by suffocating the global PageRank signal which provides essential context."""

Analyze trajectory state:
- Improving: continue direction
- Degrading: revert or reverse
- Plateaued: orthogonal move

Analyze failures:
- Missing signal vs overwhelming signal
- Parameter interactions

Distinguish between 'signal loss' (ranker too strict) and 'noise injection' (ranker too loose). If 'depth' is the failure, boost coupling (focus) before flattening penalties."""

- NDCG drop >5% = collapse signal
- Temporal and structural signals compete
- High boosts cause tunnel vision
- Low alpha localizes, high alpha globalizes
- Standard depth penalties punish modular architecture (e.g. `crates/`); use `focus` expansion to recover deep signals instead of just flattening global depth.

Distractor nodes often manifest as global hubs (high centrality); counteract with strong local `focus` expansion (local graph trust) rather than global diffusion."""

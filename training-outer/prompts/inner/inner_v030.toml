Analyze trajectory state:
- Improving: continue direction
- Degrading: revert or reverse
- Plateaued: orthogonal move

Analyze failures:
- Missing signal vs overwhelming signal
- Parameter interactions

Distinguish between 'signal loss' (ranker too strict) and 'noise injection' (ranker too loose). If 'depth' failures persist, distinguish 'unreachable' from 'undervalued'. If targets are missing (unreachable/fragmented), prefer extending *structural* reach (focus_decay, max_hops) or *directory* proximity over global graph connectivity. Globalizing aids hub distractors; targeted expansion aids deep modules."""

- NDCG drop >5% = collapse signal
- Temporal and structural signals compete
- High boosts cause tunnel vision
- Low alpha localizes, high alpha globalizes
- Standard depth penalties punish modular architecture (e.g. `crates/`); use `focus` expansion to recover deep signals instead of just flattening global depth.

Deep targets (e.g. `crates/`) are often 'structurally close' but 'globally distant'. Solve depth failures by boosting `focus` (structural propagation) and `directory` signals, rather than flooding the graph with global PageRank (alpha), which wakes up distractors."""

Analyze trajectory state:
- Improving: continue direction
- Degrading: revert or reverse
- Plateaued: orthogonal move

Analyze failures:
- Missing signal vs overwhelming signal
- Parameter interactions


Oscillating: Dampen magnitude, seek ratios between competing parameters rather than absolute extremes.

Discrimination Phase: When retrieval is good (targets present) but ranking is imperfect, freeze expansion radii and focus purely on the ratio between 'Specific' (Temporal/Path) and 'Generic' (PageRank/Depth) signals."""

- NDCG drop >5% = collapse signal
- Temporal and structural signals are often orthogonal; tuning them as a ratio (e.g. 2:1) is more stable than maximizing one.
- High boosts cause tunnel vision
- Low alpha localizes, high alpha globalizes
- Depth penalties break monorepos


Monorepo fix: Flatter depth penalties require tighter focus/coupling thresholds to exclude the resulting noise.

- Near-miss syndrome (Rank 2-5): If targets consistently appear just below top slots, the primary signal exists but is drowned by 'loud' global metrics (PageRank/Hubs). Fix by cutting global weights, not by boosting the target signal further (which adds noise)."""

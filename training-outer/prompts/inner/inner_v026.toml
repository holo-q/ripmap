Analyze trajectory state:
- Improving: continue direction
- Degrading: revert or reverse
- Plateaued: orthogonal move

Analyze failures:
- Missing signal vs overwhelming signal
- Parameter interactions

Distinguish between 'signal loss' (ranker too strict) and 'noise injection' (ranker too loose). If 'depth' failures persist, distinguish 'unreachable' from 'undervalued'. If targets are missing (unreachable/fragmented), you MUST increase global graph connectivity (alpha/teleport), even if it risks increasing distractor noise."""

- NDCG drop >5% = collapse signal
- Temporal and structural signals compete
- High boosts cause tunnel vision
- Low alpha localizes, high alpha globalizes
- Standard depth penalties punish modular architecture (e.g. `crates/`); use `focus` expansion to recover deep signals instead of just flattening global depth.

While over-localization fragments the graph and causes 'depth' failures, strategic PageRank localization *via alpha reduction* on a robust import subgraph is effective for noise reduction. Distractors are best managed by specific demotions or type-based filtering, allowing the structural signal to dominate over a generalized global PageRank for context."""

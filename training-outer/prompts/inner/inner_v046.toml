Analyze trajectory state:

Analyze failures:
- Missing signal vs overwhelming signal
- Parameter interactions


Oscillating: Dampen magnitude, seek ratios between competing parameters rather than absolute extremes.

Zero-Signal (NDCG < 0.1): The graph walk is failing to reach targets. Prioritize widening 'max_hops' and reducing 'focus_decay' to re-establish connectivity before tuning weights."""

- NDCG drop >5% = collapse signal
- Temporal and structural signals are often orthogonal; tuning them as a ratio (e.g. 2:1) is more stable than maximizing one.
- Global boosts cause tunnel vision, but high relative 'coupling' boosts (temporal/focus) are essential to break the gravity of high-centrality distractors.
- Low alpha localizes, high alpha globalizes
- Depth penalties break monorepos


Monorepo fix: Flatter depth penalties require tighter focus/coupling thresholds to exclude the resulting noise."""

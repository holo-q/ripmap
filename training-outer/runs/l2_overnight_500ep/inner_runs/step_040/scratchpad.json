Need to:\n1. Increase `boost_mentioned_ident` and `boost_mentioned_file` to lift actual references above noise\n2. Possibly reduce alpha further to localize more\n3.

      "reasoning": "Looking at the failures, I see a critical pattern: **structural reference signals are NOT propagating** from seed files to their logical neighbors. The expected files (`man.rs` ↔ `defs.rs` same-crate siblings, printer crate references) are being drowned out by distractor files and random helpers.\n\n**Failure Analysis:**\n\n1. **Failure 1 & 2**: `defs.rs` ↔ `man.rs` should be trivial - same module (`crates/core/flags/`), sibling relationship. But we're getting `helper_6.rs`, `mod_8.rs`, `deep_7.rs` - these are clearly PageRank diffusion artifacts with no structural affinity to the seed.\n\n2. **Failure 3**: `defs.rs` → printer crate hyperlink files. This requires following import/reference chains. We get some at rank 4-5, but ranks 1-3 are distractors and unrelated files.\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis:**\n\nThe PageRank is **too global** - `alpha=0.265` means 26.5% teleport probability, but the `pagerank_chat_multiplier=70.0` is massive. This combination seems to be:\n- Creating a high-PageRank \"blob\" around chat-related nodes\n- Diffusing rank broadly rather than concentrating on structural neighbors\n\nThe structural signals (`boost_mentioned_ident=10`, `boost_mentioned_file=5`) are being overwhelmed. In a 100-file curated repo with explicit distractors, we need **tighter locality** and **stronger structural edge weights**.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- `focus_max_hops=2.2` is reasonable but `focus_decay=0.22` is quite aggressive decay\n- `depth_weight_*` seems fine for monorepo structure\n- The PageRank multiplier at 70x for chat files is likely creating score inflation that drowns out edge-based proximity\n\n**Proposed Direction:**\n\n1. **Reduce pagerank_chat_multiplier** - 70.0 is too hot, it's making chat-adjacent files dominate regardless of structural relevance\n2. **Increase boost_mentioned_ident** - structural symbol references need to cut through the noise more\n3. **Reduce alpha slightly** - more local diffusion, less teleportation to global high-PageRank nodes\n4. **Increase focus_max_hops** - allow structural chain following for cross-crate references\n\nThis is Episode 2, coming from NDCG 0.881 → 0.8781 (slight dip). We should make a measured adjustment, not a dramatic pivot.",

Let me analyze the trajectory and propose parameter changes.\n\n\n\n**Trajectory Analysis:**\n- E1 → E2 → E3: 0.881 → 0.878 → 0.8793 — slight oscillation, essentially plateaued\n- Previous strategies focused on reducing PageRank inflation and amplifying structural signals\n- Still seeing 3 failures per episode, same failure patterns recurring\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nAll 3 failures are in the curated test repo (100 files). The failures show:\n\n1. **FAILURE 1** (tests/regression.rs → same-dir test files): NDCG 0.482\n   - Expected: tests/feature.rs, tests/misc.rs, tests/util.rs (same directory siblings)\n   - Got: lib/mod_3.rs, helper files, distractor files dominating\n   - Diagnosis: **Same-directory locality not working** — tests/ files not boosting each other\n\n2. **FAILURE 2** (defs.rs → test files): NDCG 0.450\n   - Expected: tests/binary.rs, tests/regression.rs\n   - Got: distractor files, then tests/binary.rs at rank 4\n   - Diagnosis: **Cross-crate test dependencies not surfacing** — distractor_5.rs beating tests\n\n3. **FAILURE 3** (tests/regression.rs → cross-crate printer): NDCG 0.387\n   - Expected: crates/printer/src/summary.rs\n   - Got: other tests, lib files, distractor, then printer at rank 5\n   - Diagnosis: **Cross-crate reference chain failing** — needs more hops to reach printer\n\n**Key Signals:**\n\nThe pattern is clear: **structural edge signals are being overwhelmed by global PageRank**.\n- `distractor_*.rs` files appearing at top ranks = files with high global PageRank but no structural connection to query\n- Same-directory files (tests/*.rs) should trivially beat distant files\n- `pagerank_alpha=0.265` is localizing but not enough\n- `focus_max_hops=2.2` too low to chain across tests→src→crates\n\n**Parameter Interactions:**\n- `pagerank_alpha` low (0.265) should localize, but `pagerank_chat_multiplier` at 70 might be amplifying distractor global rank\n- `boost_focus_expansion=2.45` is too weak relative to base PageRank scores of bridge files\n- `focus_decay=0.22` decays too fast across hops\n- `depth_weight_*` might be penalizing test files (often \"shallow\" in tree)\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n1. **Lower pagerank_chat_multiplier** (70→50): Reduce global PageRank's ability to overwhelm local structure\n2. **Increase boost_focus_expansion** (2.45→4.0): Let hop-chain signals compete with distractor noise\n3. **Increase focus_max_hops** (2.2→3.0): Allow cross-crate chains (tests→src→crates/printer)\n4. **Decrease focus_decay** (0.22→0.15): Signals don't die as fast across hops\n5. **Increase depth_weight_root** (0.34→0.40): Tests often at root level, should get more signal",

      "reasoning": "Based on the ripmap, I can now analyze your inner optimizer prompt and provide a response as the \"gradient approximator\" for this meta-learning optimization task.\n\n---\n\n\n\n**Trajectory Analysis:**\n- E1: 0.881 (2 failures) → E2: 0.878 (3 failures) → E3: 0.879 (3 failures) → E4: 0.8793\n- Clear plateau pattern: oscillating around ~0.878-0.881 for 4 episodes\n- The strategy descriptions show progressive attempts to balance PageRank global vs local signals\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nFAILURE 1 (tests/regression.rs → defs.rs, binary.rs):\n- Getting: `helper_1.rs, distractor_0.rs, binary.rs, deep_2.rs, defs.rs`\n- Expected at top: `defs.rs, binary.rs`\n- Problem: **Distractors and helpers ranking above structural targets**\n- `distractor_0.rs` at rank 2 suggests global PageRank is bleeding unconnected high-degree nodes\n- `defs.rs` demoted to rank 5 despite being in a cross-crate path\n\nFAILURE 2 (crates/core/flags/defs.rs → printer/color.rs, printer/standard.rs):\n- Getting: `test_9.rs, test_4.rs, distractor_0.rs, color.rs, deep_7.rs`\n- Expected at top: `color.rs, standard.rs`\n- Problem: **Test files and distractors dominating cross-crate navigation**\n- Tests at rank 1-2 suggests they have high incoming references but shouldn't rank for \"Extend\" intent\n- Cross-crate targets (`printer/*`) are being suppressed by in-crate noise\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **Distractor files appearing consistently** - These likely have high global PageRank (many incoming refs) but no structural relationship to the query. Current `pagerank_alpha: 0.265` is localizing but not enough.\n\n2. **Test files acting as false positives** - Tests reference many files (imports) so they accumulate PageRank, but for \"Extend\" intent, test files shouldn't dominate.\n\n3. **Cross-crate hops blocked** - `defs.rs → printer/*` is a 2-hop path through the symbol graph. Current `focus_max_hops: 2.2` should allow this, but decay (`focus_decay: 0.22`) may be too aggressive.\n\n4. **Missing structural gating** - The ranking treats all PageRank contributors equally. Need some form of connectivity gating: files only relevant if they share direct/indirect symbol edges with seed.\n\n**Parameter Interaction Analysis:**\n\n- `pagerank_alpha` (0.265) × `pagerank_chat_multiplier` (70.0) = High personalization to seed file, but distractors still leak through via global component\n- `focus_decay` (0.22) with `focus_max_hops` (2.2) means 2nd hop gets ~0.78 weight, 3rd hop ~0.56. This should be adequate but may not be enough if PageRank dominates.\n- `boost_focus_expansion` (2.45) may not be strong enough to overcome global PageRank noise\n\n**Orthogonal Move Recommendation:**\n\nSince plateau persists, we need a structural shift rather than parameter tuning:\n\n1. **Increase focus expansion dramatically** - Make hop-connected files dominate over disconnected high-PageRank nodes\n2. **Reduce global PageRank bleed** - Lower `pagerank_chat_multiplier` to reduce the seed file's direct influence, while increasing structural signals\n3. **Test file suppression** - Depth logic may help (tests often in shallow directories), but might need explicit handling\n4. **Slower focus decay for cross-crate** - The 2-hop path from `defs.rs → printer/*` needs stronger signal propagation",

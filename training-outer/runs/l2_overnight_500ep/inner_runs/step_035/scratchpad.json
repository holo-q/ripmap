      "reasoning": "This is the first episode with NDCG 0.8817. I need to analyze the two failures to understand what's happening:\n\n**Failure 1: tests/regression.rs**\n- Query is a test file in `tests/` directory\n- Expected: glob/gitignore library files (`crates/globset/src/glob.rs`, `crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs`, `crates/ignore/src/overrides.rs`)\n- Actual: Got `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` files and only one expected file (`crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs`)\n- NDCG: 0.396 (poor)\n- Commit context: \"intent: Extend\"\n\n**Failure 2: crates/printer/src/standard.rs**\n- Query is a printer implementation file\n- Expected: flags definitions, searcher components\n- Actual: Got some distractors (`lib/mod_8.rs`, `src/distractor_15.rs`) but also some correct files at lower positions\n- NDCG: 0.395 (poor)\n- Commit context: \"intent: Explore\"\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. Both failures have similar NDCG scores (~0.4), suggesting systematic issues rather than random noise\n2. The \"deep_*.rs\" and \"distractor_*.rs\" files appearing suggests the test repo has intentional distractors\n3. The correct files ARE appearing but at wrong positions - gitignore at position 2, glue/core/defs at positions 3-5\n4. Current `boost_focus_expansion: 2.45` and `focus_decay: 0.22` may not be propagating enough signal through structural relationships\n5. Current `depth_weight_moderate: 0.41` vs `depth_weight_root: 0.34` - moderate depth is weighted higher than root\n\n**Parameter interactions:**\n- `pagerank_alpha: 0.265` (relatively low - localizes PageRank, may help with structural propagation but limits global reach)\n- `boost_mentioned_ident: 10.0` and `boost_mentioned_file: 5.0` - high boosts for explicit mentions\n- The distractor files appearing first suggests PageRank structure isn't differentiating well\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nThe distractors (`deep_*.rs`, `distractor_*.rs`, `lib/mod_*.rs`) are likely connected in the symbol graph. With low alpha (0.265), PageRank is localizing around seed files but the graph topology favors these distractors. The expected files have semantic relationships but perhaps fewer structural (call graph) connections.\n\n**Strategy for first episode:**\nSince this is episode 1, I should make a conservative adjustment to better understand the landscape:\n1. Slightly increase `pagerank_alpha` to allow more global structure to emerge\n2. Increase `boost_focus_expansion` to amplify signals from semantically related files\n3. Increase `focus_max_hops` to reach further into the graph\n4. Reduce some of the extreme identifier boosts to prevent tunnel vision",

      "reasoning": "Looking at this optimization problem for the inner loop of your MESA-style promptgram training. Let me analyze the failures and current parameters.\n\n\n\n**Failure Analysis:**\n\n1. **Failures 1 & 2**: Symmetric failures between `flags/defs.rs` ↔ `flags/doc/man.rs`. These are sibling files in the same module that should have strong structural coupling, but distractors (`deep_*.rs`, `distractor_0.rs`, `test_*.rs`) are dominating.\n\n2. **Failure 3**: From `flags/defs.rs` expecting `printer/` files - this is a cross-crate dependency requiring multi-hop traversal. Getting `hyperlink/aliases.rs` at position 1 is good, but then distractors flood positions 2-5.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nThe core issue is **distractor dominance** - files named `deep_*`, `distractor_*`, and `test_*` are overwhelming the semantic signal. This suggests:\n- PageRank is spreading too much weight to structurally connected but semantically irrelevant files\n- Focus expansion isn't strong enough to pull in the actual related files\n- The curated repo likely has artificial structure that PageRank exploits\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- `pagerank_alpha = 0.265` is quite low (localizing), yet distractors still dominate\n- `focus_max_hops = 2.2` should allow reaching sibling files\n- `boost_focus_expansion = 2.45` may be insufficient to overcome distractor PageRank\n\n**Parameter Interactions:**\n- Low `pagerank_alpha` + high `pagerank_chat_multiplier` creates islands\n- `focus_decay = 0.22` is very aggressive - signal dies quickly across hops\n- `boost_mentioned_ident = 10.0` may be pulling in false positives\n\n**Proposed Direction:**\nSince episode 1 had NDCG=0.882 and E2 dropped to 0.878, the previous change (\"Increase global reach and focus expansion\") slightly degraded performance. The strategy was directionally correct but overshot or missed the mark.\n\nFor this case:\n1. **Increase structural coupling signal** - the flags↔man relationship is structural, so `boost_temporal_coupling` could help if they're co-committed\n2. **Reduce distractor penetration** - deeper depth penalties for files with distractor-like patterns (though we can't do that directly)\n3. **Strengthen focus expansion** - the multi-hop chains need more propagation\n4. **Increase alpha slightly** - allow PageRank to escape local minima but not too much",

      "reasoning": "I need to analyze this optimization trajectory and propose parameter changes. Let me reason through the failures and current state.\n\n## REASONING:\n\n**Trajectory Analysis:**\n- E1→E2: NDCG dropped from 0.882 to 0.878 (slight degradation)\n- E2→E3: NDCG increased slightly to 0.879 (marginal improvement, essentially plateaued)\n- We're in a plateau state, suggesting need for an orthogonal move\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nLooking at all 5 failures, there's a striking pattern: **distractor files are dominating rankings**. Files like:\n- `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs`\n- `src/utils/helper_*.rs`\n- `tests/test_*.rs`\n- `src/distractor_*.rs`\n- `lib/mod_*.rs`\n\nThese appear consistently in top results when they shouldn't. The expected files are real crate files (`crates/*/...`) but distractors from `src/`, `lib/`, `tests/test_*` are winning.\n\n**Root Cause Diagnosis:**\n\n1. **Depth penalties aren't working**: `deep_*` files are in `src/core/internal/` (deep path) but `depth_weight_deep: 0.20` isn't penalizing enough. These should be near-zero.\n\n2. **PageRank is favoring distractors**: The graph structure seems to give high centrality to distractor files. With `pagerank_alpha: 0.265` (relatively low), we're staying local but local includes these distractors somehow.\n\n3. **Semantic signal is too weak**: `boost_mentioned_ident: 10.0` and `boost_mentioned_file: 5.0` aren't enough to overcome structural PageRank scores from distractors.\n\n4. **Focus expansion isn't reaching real dependencies**: `focus_max_hops: 2.2` and `focus_decay: 0.22` should allow multi-hop traversal, but real dependencies (e.g., `searcher→printer→flags`) aren't being surfaced.\n\n5. **The \"curated (100 files)\" repo has many distractors**: Files named `distractor_*`, `helper_*`, `deep_*`, `test_*`, `mod_*` are specifically designed to test noise rejection.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nThe distractor files likely have artificially high PageRank because they might be highly connected in the synthetic graph. We need to:\n1. **Dramatically increase depth penalties** for deep/internal paths\n2. **Boost semantic signals** to overcome structural noise\n3. **Penalize generic naming patterns** (though we can't do this directly with current params)\n\n**Parameter Interactions:**\n- `depth_weight_deep` at 0.20 is still too generous for `src/core/internal/` paths\n- `boost_focus_expansion: 2.45` isn't enough when distractors have high base PageRank\n- `pagerank_chat_multiplier: 70.0` is high but chat context isn't helping distinguish real from distractor\n\n**Proposed Strategy - Orthogonal Move:**\nSince we're plateaued, let's make a more aggressive structural change:\n1. Slash `depth_weight_deep` to near-zero (0.05)\n2. Significantly boost semantic signals (`boost_mentioned_ident`, `boost_mentioned_file`)\n3. Increase `boost_focus_expansion` to help real cross-crate deps\n4. Slightly increase `focus_max_hops` to reach further through real dependency chains\n\n```json",

This is a clear plateau - we've been stuck in a local optimum for 4 episodes.\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nThe failures are devastating - distractors are dominating:\n- `src/distractor_*.rs`, `lib/mod_*.rs`, `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs`, `src/utils/helper_*.rs`\n\nThese distractor paths share characteristics:\n1. Generic names (helper_, mod_, deep_, distractor_, test_)\n2. Flat numeric suffixes (_0, _1, _2, etc.)\n3. Located in `src/core/internal/`, `lib/`, `src/utils/`\n\nThe **expected** files have:\n1. Specific semantic names (hiargs.rs, gitignore.rs, walk.rs, defs.rs, man.rs)\n2. Located in `crates/*/` structure\n3. Real functional purposes reflected in names\n\n**Current Problem Diagnosis:**\n\nThe current parameters have `depth_weight_deep: 0.20` - this is supposed to penalize deep paths, but `src/core/internal/deep_7.rs` is showing up everywhere. The issue is that \"deep\" in the path name doesn't necessarily trigger depth weight - it's about actual depth levels.\n\nMore critically: PageRank is being corrupted. With `pagerank_alpha: 0.265` (low), we're localizing, but the distractors are well-connected in the fake graph. The distractor files likely have many cross-references (they were designed to be noise).\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nThe semantic signals (`boost_mentioned_ident`, `boost_mentioned_file`) at 10.0 and 5.0 aren't strong enough to overcome PageRank scores from highly-connected distractors. Meanwhile `boost_chat_file: 14.0` and `boost_focus_expansion: 2.45` are spreading signal to neighbors indiscriminately.\n\n**Orthogonal Move Needed:**\n\nRather than continuing to tweak the same levers, we need to:\n1. **Dramatically increase semantic signal** - files with matching semantic content should dominate\n2. **Reduce structural spread** - `focus_max_hops: 2.2` is letting signal leak to distractors\n3. **Increase depth penalty for genuinely deep paths** - vendor weight is 0.01, deep is 0.20, but deep is still too generous\n\n**",

      "reasoning": "Let me analyze the failure patterns systematically:\n\n**Trajectory State: PLATEAUED** (NDCG hovering around 0.878-0.882)\n- E4 tried \"semantic dominance pivot\" with massive identifier/file boosts → still 5 failures\n- The system is stuck in a local minimum where distractor files consistently outrank real dependencies\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nAll 5 failures share a striking commonality:\n1. The **expected files are cross-crate real dependencies** (tests/regression.rs, crates/ignore/src/dir.rs, crates/printer/src/json.rs, etc.)\n2. The **actual top-ranked files are distractors** with generic names (distractor_5.rs, helper_6.rs, mod_3.rs, deep_2.rs, test_9.rs)\n\nThe distractors are beating real files at positions 1-4, while real files appear at position 4-5. This suggests:\n- **Graph topology issue**: Distractors have artificially high connectivity in the curated test repo\n- **Semantic matching isn't sufficient**: Even with boost_mentioned_ident=10.0, distractors win\n\n**Key Insight:** The distractor files have GENERIC names (helper_*, mod_*, deep_*, distractor_*, test_*) while real files have SPECIFIC names (regression.rs, hiargs.rs, gitignore.rs). Yet distractors still win. This means:\n\n1. **PageRank is dominating semantic signal** - distractors are hubs in the graph\n2. **Depth penalties aren't working** - distractors at deep paths (src/core/internal/deep_2.rs) still rank high\n\n**The Real Problem:** Current `pagerank_alpha=0.265` is too low (too local), trapping signal in distractor neighborhoods. But previous attempt to raise it (E1) degraded from 0.882→0.878.\n\n**Orthogonal Move Required:**\n\nThe previous strategies tried:\n- More semantic boost (didn't work - distractors still win)\n- More depth penalty (didn't work - distractors at depth still rank)\n- Higher alpha (slight degradation)\n\nWhat HASN'T been tried: **Aggressive distractor topology breaking**\n\nThe distractors win because they have high PageRank centrality. We need to:\n1. **Massively increase chat_multiplier** to let seed context dominate over graph structure\n2. **Reduce focus_max_hops** to prevent diffusion into distractor neighborhoods\n3. **Increase depth_weight penalties more aggressively** for deep paths where distractors live\n\nBut wait - looking at actual failures, distractors at ALL depths are winning:\n- src/distractor_5.rs (shallow)\n- src/utils/helper_6.rs (moderate)\n- src/core/internal/deep_2.rs (deep)\n\nThis means depth penalty alone won't work. The issue is **PageRank structural dominance**.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** The curated repo has distractor files that are highly interconnected (forming a PageRank trap). The semantic signal from real file names gets diluted.\n\n**Proposed Orthogonal Move:**\n1. **Dramatically increase pagerank_chat_multiplier** (70→120) - give seed files overwhelming starting mass\n2. **Reduce focus_max_hops** (2.2→1.5) - cut diffusion before it reaches distractor hubs\n3. **Increase boost_mentioned_file** (5→12) - when query IS a filename, boost it harder\n4. **Decrease pagerank_alpha slightly** (0.265→0.24) - more local = less distractor hub influence",

      "reasoning": "Now I understand the system well. Let me analyze the optimization problem:\n\n\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nAll 3 failures share a critical pattern:\n1. **Query is a file path** (e.g., \"crates/ignore/src/dir.rs\")\n2. **Seed file = query file** (the query IS the file)\n3. **Expected: tests/regression.rs** - the test file that exercises this code\n4. **Actual: distractor files dominate** (helper_*.rs, distractor_*.rs, deep_*.rs, lib/mod_3.rs)\n\nThis is a **test↔source coupling failure**. When a user queries a specific source file (especially with \"Debug\" intent), they want to see related test files. The distractors are winning because:\n\n1. **High-centrality clique effect**: The helper/distractor files likely form a tightly interconnected subgraph. With 100 files in the curated repo, these synthetic distractors probably reference each other heavily, creating a PageRank hotspot.\n\n2. **Alpha is too low (0.265)**: Low alpha means less weight on personalization (teleportation to seed files) and more on following graph edges. This lets the distractor clique capture rank.\n\n3. **Insufficient file match boost**: When the query IS a filename (not just mentions a file), the `boost_mentioned_file: 5.0` is being overwhelmed by the graph structure.\n\n4. **Missing test coupling signal**: The `boost_test_coupling` parameter exists in RankingConfig but isn't in the current parameter set being optimized. `tests/regression.rs` isn't getting the boost it needs from path-aware test↔crate coupling.\n\n**Trajectory Analysis:**\n\nLooking at E1-E6 history:\n- NDCG oscillates 0.878 → 0.882 → 0.879 → 0.881 → 0.882 → 0.881 → 0.879\n- Clear plateau around 0.88\n- Previous strategies tried: chat dominance, file-query dominance, semantic boost amplification\n- The fundamental issue: **we're optimizing around the distractor clique rather than breaking through it**\n\n**The Orthogonal Move:**\n\nThe key insight from the key training insights: \"Distractor files (helper_*.rs) likely form high-centrality clique capturing PageRank\"\n\nTo break the distractor clique, we need a **structural intervention**, not just boosting seeds harder:\n\n1. **Increase alpha significantly** (0.265 → 0.55+): Higher alpha means MORE graph following but ALSO means dangling node mass and personalization are weighted at (1-α). Wait - that's backwards. Higher α means MORE following edges, LESS teleportation. We need LOWER alpha actually to escape the clique via teleportation... but we're already at 0.265.\n\n   Actually re-reading the PageRank formula:\n   ```\n   PR(v) = (1-α) * personalization[v] + α * Σ(PR(u) / out_degree[u])\n   ```\n   - Lower α = more teleportation weight, less edge following\n   - We're at α=0.265, so 73.5% is teleportation weight\n   \n   But teleportation goes according to `normalized_personalization`, which is biased toward chat files via `pagerank_chat_multiplier: 70.0`.\n\n2. **The real problem**: When query=filename, the seed file gets chat_file boost, but the TEST file doesn't. The test file (`tests/regression.rs`) needs to be boosted when the SEED is a source file that it tests.\n\n3. **Parameter gap**: We need `boost_test_coupling` to be active, but it's not in the optimized parameter set. The RankingConfig has it (default 5.0) but the inner promptgram's parameters don't include it.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\nGiven we can only tune the parameters in the prompt, the orthogonal move is:\n\n1. **Drastically reduce focus_max_hops** (2.2 → 1.0): Stop bleeding rank to distant files via graph expansion. The distractors are likely 2+ hops away.\n\n2. **Increase depth_weight_vendor** penalty: While distractors aren't in vendor paths, this shows the direction - penalize \"noise\" structural positions.\n\n3. **Increase boost_mentioned_file dramatically** (5.0 → 25.0): When the query IS a file, make that signal dominate over graph structure.\n\n4. **Increase pagerank_alpha** (0.265 → 0.15): Even MORE teleportation weight (85% teleportation!) to overwhelm the clique with seed-biased random walk.\n\nActually wait - we should reduce alpha to increase teleportation. α=0.265 gives (1-α)=0.735 teleportation weight. To get MORE teleportation, we need LOWER α. But we're already quite low.\n\nThe issue might be that even with high teleportation, the teleportation itself goes to nodes according to personalization - and the personalization isn't concentrating enough on the ACTUAL seed vs the whole graph.\n\n**New insight**: `pagerank_chat_multiplier: 70.0` boosts chat files in personalization, but the seed file is the chat file. What we need is for the TEST file to also get boost. Since we can't add new parameters, we need to:\n\n1. Make the seed's boost SO massive that it overwhelms everything\n2.

      "reasoning": "Looking at this optimization problem, let me analyze the trajectory and failures:\n\n\nThe trajectory shows clear stagnation around NDCG ~0.88. All failures (3/3) share a critical pattern: **distractor files dominating top ranks** in the curated 100-file repo. Looking at the actual vs expected:\n\n1. **Failure 1** (tests/regression.rs → crates/ignore/src/dir.rs): Test file has no call-graph edges to source - it's a test that *uses* the code but tree-sitter won't see that as a \"call\". The current architecture has no signal connecting test files to their source counterparts.\n\n2. **Failure 2** (crates/core/flags/defs.rs → hiargs.rs, printer, searcher): Partial hit (core.rs, glue.rs in position 3-4) but distractors occupy top 2 slots. The cross-crate dependencies exist but distractor clique overpowers them.\n\n3. **Failure 3** (crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs → defs.rs): defs.rs appears at position 4, but deep/random files flood top 3. This is a single-hop dependency being swamped.\n\nThe KEY INSIGHT from training history is correct: **test↔source coupling signal is architecturally absent**. But within current parameter space, we can't manufacture that signal - we can only tune how existing signals propagate.\n\n**Parameter analysis:**\n- `pagerank_alpha=0.265` is already low, localizing walks\n- `boost_chat_file=14.0` is high but chat_multiplier=70.0 might be causing tunnel vision\n- `boost_mentioned_file=5.0` seems low given query IS the filename\n- `focus_max_hops=2.2` might allow distractor contamination at hop 2\n- `depth_weight_deep=0.20` still gives non-trivial weight to deep files where distractors live\n\nThe distractor dominance pattern suggests the personalization vector isn't concentrating enough probability mass on the seed's immediate neighborhood. The distractors form a tightly-coupled clique that becomes an attractor basin in PageRank.\n\n**Proposed strategy:** Extreme seed localization by:\n1. Reducing `focus_max_hops` to 1.5 to cut off distractor contamination at hop 2\n2. Boosting `boost_mentioned_file` significantly (query=filename should DOMINATE)\n3. Reducing `depth_weight_deep` further to penalize distractor file locations\n4. Slightly increasing `focus_decay` to attenuate signal falloff faster",

      "reasoning": "Now I understand the codebase context. This is ripmap, a code intelligence/ranking tool, and you're running an outer-loop optimizer that tries to find optimal parameters for the ranking algorithm.\n\nLet me analyze the current state:\n\n## \n\n**Trajectory Analysis:**\n- NDCG has been oscillating between 0.878-0.882 for 9 episodes - clear **plateau** signal\n- The insight is correct: \"All 3 failures are filename queries - architectural gap in test↔source coupling cannot be fixed by parameters alone\"\n- Current strategy focus has been on `boost_mentioned_file`, `focus_max_hops`, and `pagerank_chat_multiplier` - all attempting to boost seed locality\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\nAll 3 failures share the exact same seed file: `crates/core/flags/defs.rs`, but expect dramatically different targets:\n1. `tests/binary.rs, tests/regression.rs` (test files)\n2. `crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs` (sibling module)\n3. `crates/printer/src/hyperlink/*.rs, crates/printer/src/lib.rs` (cross-crate consumer)\n\nThe actual top-ranked files are **distractor clique members** (`src/distractor_*.rs`, `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs`, `lib/mod_*.rs`, `src/utils/helper_*.rs`). This is the curated repo's intentional high-PageRank attractor basin.\n\n**Core Problem:**\nThe parameters cannot distinguish:\n- Test files that test the seed (structural relationship)\n- Same-crate siblings (namespace proximity)\n- Cross-crate consumers (graph edge relationship)\n\n...from the distractor clique that has artificially high internal connectivity.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nThe distractor clique wins because of intra-clique density. The legitimate targets (test files, sibling modules, cross-crate consumers) have **sparse but meaningful** edges to the seed, while distractors have **dense but meaningless** edges among themselves.\n\n**Parameter Interactions:**\n- `pagerank_chat_multiplier=70` is very high - but the seed can't overpower the clique\n- `focus_max_hops=2.2` constrains diffusion but clique members can still reach high ranks via their own internal paths\n- `depth_weight_vendor=0.01` penalizes vendor but distractors aren't in vendor paths\n\n**Proposed Strategy: Structural isolation via aggressive anti-density heuristic**\n\nThe problem isn't about boosting the right things - it's about **penalizing density itself**. If we can:\n1. Reduce alpha to hyper-localize (prevent diffusion into clique)\n2. Massively boost direct edges from seed (1-hop dominance)\n3. Reduce `focus_max_hops` to nearly 1 (starve multi-hop paths)\n\nBut this has been tried (E7-E8). The architectural gap exists.\n\n**Alternative: Semantic signal amplification**\nThe filename queries should trigger `boost_mentioned_file`. But the seed file IS `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` - the query matches the seed exactly. The expected files are NOT matching the query string.\n\nWait - that's the fundamental issue! When the query is a filename, `boost_mentioned_file` boosts files matching that filename, not files *related to* that filename. The test expects related files (tests, siblings, consumers) to appear, but the current boost system doesn't understand that relationship.\n\n**What can parameters actually do?**\nGiven the architectural gap, the best we can do is:\n1. Maximize graph-edge signal (if tests import/reference the seed)\n2. Minimize noise from clique via alpha reduction\n3. Trust temporal coupling to surface co-changed files\n\n**Proposed changes:**\n- Reduce `pagerank_alpha` further (0.15) - extreme localization to prevent clique amplification\n- Increase `boost_temporal_coupling` (6.0) - if tests change with seed, they'll surface\n- Reduce `focus_max_hops` to 1.5 - prevent 2+ hop diffusion into clique\n- Increase `focus_decay` to 0.35 - faster decay kills peripheral clique members",

      "reasoning": "I see you've pasted an L2 (outer loop) promptgram optimization scenario. Let me analyze the optimization trajectory and propose a gradient step in concept space.\n\nREASONING:\n\n**Trajectory State Analysis:**\n- NDCG plateau at ~0.88 for 10 episodes (0.878-0.882 range)\n- Same 3 failures persist: curated repo queries against `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` and related files\n- Distractor files (`src/utils/helper_6.rs`, `src/distractor_0.rs`, `lib/mod_*.rs`) consistently beating expected results\n- The curated repo appears specifically designed to test distractor resistance\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nBoth failures share critical characteristics:\n1. **Seed files are in `crates/core/flags/`** - legitimate structured code\n2. **Expected files are also in `crates/` hierarchy** - same namespace\n3. **Actual top results are distractors**: `src/utils/`, `src/distractor_*`, `lib/mod_*`\n4. **Only one expected file (`glue.rs`) makes it into top 5** - partial signal exists\n\nThe distractors are winning despite:\n- No temporal coupling to seed (different directories)\n- No identifier mention matches (generic names)\n- No chat file boost (no context)\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis:**\n\nThe PageRank attractor basin hypothesis from training insights is correct. The distractors likely form a dense clique with high internal linking (they reference each other heavily), creating a structural PageRank trap. The seed's PageRank diffuses into this clique rather than flowing to structurally similar files.\n\n**What Previous Episodes Tried:**\n- E6-E10: Localization strategies (low alpha, reduced hops) - plateau\n- E1-E5: Semantic boost strategies - some improvement then plateau\n\n**Orthogonal Move Needed:**\n\nThe insight \"namespace locality\" from training hasn't been exploited. When a seed is in `crates/core/flags/`, files in `crates/` should get preferential treatment over files in `src/` or `lib/`. This is a structural prior that's missing.\n\nHowever, we can't add new architectural features via parameter tuning alone. What we CAN do:\n\n1. **Exploit focus_expansion more aggressively** - it's currently at 2.45 but with focus_max_hops=2.2, the expansion radius is limited. Increasing this might help spread to structurally similar files before distractors absorb rank.\n\n2. **Reduce PageRank diffusion to strangers** - lower alpha (currently 0.265) further would reduce random jumps into distractor clique, BUT previous episodes tried this.\n\n3. **Bet on temporal_coupling** - at 4.20, it's significant but maybe not enough to overcome structural dominance. If `crates/core/flags/` files genuinely change together (git history coupling), boosting this could help.\n\n4. **File-level matching amplification** - `boost_mentioned_file` at 5.0 and `boost_chat_file` at 14.0. Since the query IS a file path, pushing these higher could help anchor to the structural neighborhood.\n\n**Key Interaction Identified:**\n`focus_max_hops` × `focus_decay` × `pagerank_alpha` together determine how far the \"sphere of relevance\" extends. Currently: 2.2 hops, 0.22 decay, 0.265 alpha.\n\nAt 2.2 hops with 0.22 decay:\n- Hop 0: weight 1.0\n- Hop 1: weight 0.78\n- Hop 2: weight ~0.55\n\nThis is reasonable but perhaps too much diffusion leaks to distractors at hop boundaries.\n\n**Proposed Strategy: \"Crate affinity via aggressive seed stickiness\"**\n\nRather than trying to starve distractors (which has plateaued), let's make the seed's immediate neighborhood so \"sticky\" that rank accumulates there before diffusing outward.\n\nChanges:\n1. **Reduce `focus_max_hops`** to 1.5 (fractional = probabilistic truncation at boundary)\n2. **Increase `boost_focus_expansion`** to 3.5 (stronger attraction to immediate neighbors)\n3. **Increase `boost_mentioned_file`** to 7.0 (file path queries should dominate)\n4. **Slight increase to `pagerank_alpha`** to 0.30 (counter-intuitive but allows more return to personalization)\n\nThe rationale: with fewer hops but stronger expansion boost, we create a \"gravity well\" around the seed. Slightly higher alpha means more teleportation back to seed files when random walks would otherwise wander into distractor cliques.\n\n```json",

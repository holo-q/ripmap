      "reasoning": "Looking at this optimization problem, let me analyze the failure case and current state.\n\n**REASONING:**\n\nThis is episode 1 with NDCG 0.8795 overall, but the specific failure shows a much lower score of 0.247. The query is `tests/binary.rs` with expected results being `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` and `tests/regression.rs`, but we're getting unrelated files like `test_4.rs`, `deep_2.rs`, etc.\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n1. **File-based query mismatch**: When seeding from `tests/binary.rs`, the system should find structurally/semantically related files. The expected files (`flags/defs.rs`, `regression.rs`) suggest there's a logical connection (binary flags testing, test regression patterns), but the system is returning what look like random/generic files.\n\n2. **The actual results suggest PageRank is too diffuse**: Files like `test_4.rs`, `helper_6.rs`, `mod_8.rs` have the smell of \"hub\" files that score high in generic PageRank but aren't contextually relevant.\n\n3. **Missing structural signal**: With `pagerank_alpha: 0.265` (fairly low), we're already somewhat localized. The issue seems to be that the *right* edges aren't being followed.\n\n4. **Boost analysis**:\n   - `boost_mentioned_file: 5.0` - when a file is mentioned, this might not be strong enough\n   - `boost_chat_file: 14.0` - high but irrelevant for non-chat context\n   - The seed file IS `tests/binary.rs`, so there should be strong mention/context boost\n\n5. **Depth weights**: Current `depth_weight_root: 0.34`, `depth_weight_moderate: 0.41` suggests moderate depth is favored, but `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` is likely deeper structure.\n\n6. **Hypothesis**: The `depth_weight_deep: 0.20` might be suppressing signals from `crates/core/...` paths. Also, `boost_mentioned_file` at 5.0 may not be enough to overcome PageRank diffusion to hub-like test files.\n\n**Proposed intervention** (first episode = exploratory):\n- Increase `boost_mentioned_file` to strengthen seed-adjacent signals\n- Slightly increase `depth_weight_deep` to not penalize crate internals\n- Consider lowering `pagerank_alpha` slightly to further localize around seed\n\n```json",

      "reasoning": "I need to analyze this optimization problem for a ranking/relevance system. Let me understand the situation:\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n\nLooking at the failures, there's a clear pattern:\n- Query is `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` (a deep monorepo path)\n- Expected files are in `crates/printer/src/...` (cross-crate dependencies)\n- Actual top files are generic paths like `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs`, `lib/mod_*.rs`, `src/distractor_*.rs`\n\nThe ranking is surfacing generic/distractor files instead of the semantically-related printer crate files.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\n1. **Depth penalty is killing cross-crate connections**: With `depth_weight_deep: 0.20`, deep files in monorepo structures (`crates/*/src/**`) get heavily penalized. But both the seed AND the expected files are deep - so depth penalty isn't discriminating.\n\n2. **Focus/locality isn't reaching cross-crate**: The expected files are in a *different* crate (`printer` vs `core`). With `focus_max_hops: 2.2` and `focus_decay: 0.22`, the signal dies before crossing crate boundaries.\n\n3. **Distractor files winning via PageRank**: Files like `lib/mod_*.rs` and `src/distractor_*.rs` are likely hub-like in the synthetic graph, getting inflated PageRank scores.\n\n4. **Missing semantic/structural connection boost**: The query file `flags/defs.rs` should have import/reference edges to `printer/` crate. Either these edges exist but are overwhelmed, or the boost isn't high enough.\n\n**Key Interactions:**\n- `depth_weight_deep` is penalizing the *correct* answers (deep monorepo files)\n- `focus_max_hops` too low to reach cross-crate dependencies\n- `pagerank_alpha: 0.265` is moderately local, but hub distractor files still dominate\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n\nThe core issue is monorepo structure: query and answers are both in `crates/*/src/**` (deep paths), but in *different* crates. Current parameters:\n1. Penalize depth uniformly - hurting expected files\n2. Don't extend focus far enough to bridge crates\n3. Let hub-like generic files (lib/mod_*.rs) dominate via PageRank\n\nSolutions:\n- Increase `depth_weight_deep` to stop penalizing deep monorepo files\n- Increase `focus_max_hops` to bridge crate boundaries\n- Lower `pagerank_alpha` to make PageRank more local (reduce hub influence)\n- Increase `boost_mentioned_ident` to strengthen import graph signal over PageRank hubs\n- Consider if temporal signals (git recency/churn) are boosting distractors - may need reduction\n\nThe \"distractor\" files appearing suggests PageRank is the culprit. Lower alpha + higher identity boost should help.",

      "reasoning": "Now I understand the codebase structure. This is a training outer loop for optimizing ranking parameters. Let me analyze the failures and propose parameter changes.\n\n\n\nLooking at the failure patterns:\n1. All three failures have similar NDCG scores (~0.36) suggesting systematic bias\n2. In all cases, `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` and `tests/test_*.rs` files dominate the top results\n3. The seed files are in `crates/*/src/**` (monorepo structure) but the results pull generic test files and distractor files\n\nThe key insight from training notes is correct: \"Hub-like generic test files drowning out semantic connections\" and \"Cross-crate imports are the true signal but get diluted by hub PageRank\"\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n- `depth_weight_deep: 0.20` is too aggressive a penalty for `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` (depth 4) vs `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` \n- The distractor files (`src/distractor_*.rs`, `tests/test_*.rs`) are appearing because they likely have high hub-like PageRank in the synthetic graph\n- `focus_max_hops: 2.2` may be expanding into these hub files\n- The PageRank personalization isn't strong enough to anchor to the seed crate\n\n**Key observation:** The monorepo `crates/*/src/**` pattern has depth 3-4 but represents core domain code, while `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` (also depth 3-4) represents distractors. The depth heuristic can't distinguish them.\n\n**What could help:**\n1. Reduce `pagerank_alpha` to localize more around seed (current 0.265 → try 0.22)\n2. Increase `depth_weight_deep` since monorepo crates ARE deep (0.20 → 0.32)\n3. Increase `boost_focus_expansion` to favor graph-connected files over hub files (2.45 → 3.5)\n4. Lower `focus_max_hops` to prevent leaking into hub territory (2.2 → 1.8)\n5. Increase `boost_mentioned_file` to anchor more to explicit crate structure (5.0 → 7.5)\n\nThe trajectory shows steady improvement (0.880 → 0.881 → 0.882) so we're on the right track but need a stronger intervention on depth weighting and focus containment.",

Let me analyze the situation and provide the gradient approximation.\n\n\n\nLooking at the trajectory and failures:\n\n**Trajectory State: Plateau**\n- E1: 0.880 → E2: 0.881 → E3: 0.882 → E4 (current): 0.8771\n- We actually had a *slight drop* from 0.882 to 0.8771 (≈0.5% decline)\n- This suggests the E3 strategy may have overstepped\n\n**Failure Analysis:**\n\nAll three failures share a common pattern:\n1. **Query is a file in `crates/*/src/`** (real ripgrep structure)\n2. **Expected files are also in this curated set** (tests/regression.rs, cross-crate printer files)\n3. **Actual top results are dominated by**: `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs`, `src/utils/helper_*.rs`, `src/distractor_*.rs`\n\nThe distractor/deep/helper files are clearly synthetic test corpus artifacts that are acting as **PageRank hubs** - they're soaking up rank that should flow to the real cross-crate connections.\n\n**Critical Insight:**\nThe `crates/*/src/**` files (real ripgrep structure) are losing to `src/**` files (synthetic distractors) because:\n1. The depth calculation treats `crates/printer/src/util.rs` as \"deep\" (4 segments) when it should be \"moderate\"\n2. The synthetic `src/utils/helper_*.rs` files are at depth 3 but are artificial hubs\n3. Cross-crate imports (crates/printer → crates/core) represent semantic gold but get diluted\n\n**Parameter Interactions:**\n- `pagerank_alpha=0.265` is moderately local - increasing it would spread rank more globally, potentially helping cross-crate flow\n- `depth_weight_deep=0.20` is penalizing the crates files which are actually at moderate logical depth\n- `boost_focus_expansion=2.45` may be insufficient to pull in the expected cross-crate files\n\n**Proposed Direction:**\nRather than continue localizing (E3's strategy), we need to:\n1. **Increase alpha slightly** to let rank flow better across crate boundaries\n2. **Boost focus expansion** to strengthen the semantic signal from seed files\n3. **Reduce reliance on depth** since the synthetic corpus has inverted depth semantics",

The user is showing me the \"Inner Optimizer Promptgram v001\" which is the template being used to generate parameter change proposals for the ranking algorithm. Let me analyze this situation and provide a response as if I were the inner optimizer.\n\nLooking at the failure and trajectory data:\n\n****\n\nThe trajectory shows a plateau at NDCG ~0.88 with oscillation between 0.877-0.882 over episodes 1-5. The failure pattern is striking:\n\n**Failure Analysis:**\n- Query: `crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs` (specific monorepo path)\n- Expected: `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` (sibling in same crate module)\n- Actual: `src/utils/helper_6.rs`, `deep_*.rs`, `distractor_*.rs`\n\nThis is a textbook **hub dominance vs local context** failure. The actual top files are generic high-PageRank nodes (`utils`, `deep_*`, `distractor_*`) that have no semantic relation to the query. The expected file (`defs.rs`) is a sibling in the same module hierarchy.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Cross-crate signal missing**: `crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs` → `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` share `crates/core/flags/` prefix. This is local structural affinity that PageRank misses.\n2. **Distractor noise**: The `deep_*.rs` and `distractor_*.rs` files are artificial hubs in the curated corpus that don't exist in real codebases. They're absorbing PageRank.\n3. **Alpha too high**: At 0.265, the random walk still respects global graph structure too much. For intent-specific queries on specific files, we need tighter localization.\n4. **Focus expansion insufficient**: `focus_max_hops=2.2` and `focus_decay=0.22` might not be aggressive enough to surface the sibling `defs.rs`.\n\n**Trajectory Pattern:**\n- E1-E4 tried variations on depth weights and focus parameters\n- NDCG stagnant despite multiple strategy pivots\n- This suggests the bottleneck is **structural** not **parametric**—the graph topology itself (synthetic hubs) is the enemy\n\n**Proposed Move:**\nGiven the plateau and hub-dominance failure, the orthogonal move is to **aggressively de-weight global structure** and **amplify local context signals**:\n1. Drop `pagerank_alpha` below 0.2 to sever hub paths\n2. Boost `focus_decay` to spread focus signal to siblings faster\n3. Increase `boost_focus_expansion` to prioritize graph-adjacent files\n4. Slightly raise `depth_weight_moderate` to help monorepo paths\n\n**",

      "reasoning": "Let me analyze the trajectory and failures deeply:\n\n**Trajectory Analysis:**\n- E1→E2→E3: NDCG 0.880→0.881→0.882 (slow climb)\n- E3→E4→E5→E6→E7: 0.882→0.877→0.878→0.879→0.877 (oscillation/plateau)\n\nThe system peaked at E3 (0.882) and has been oscillating since. Recent strategies have focused on PageRank alpha and focus propagation, but we're stuck.\n\n**Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\nAll 5 failures share a critical pattern:\n1. **Distractors dominate**: `src/utils/helper_*.rs`, `src/distractor_*.rs`, `lib/mod_*.rs`, `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` consistently appear in top results\n2. **Expected files are in `crates/` or `tests/`**: The real targets are in structured monorepo locations\n3. **Path affinity is completely absent**: `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` → `crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs` are ADJACENT in path structure but man.rs doesn't even appear in top 5\n\n**Critical Insight:**\nThe current system has NO path-based locality signal. Focus decay/hops work on the symbol graph, but:\n- `crates/core/flags/defs.rs` and `crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs` share 3 path components\n- Yet distractors with zero path overlap win completely\n\nThe depth weights are being misapplied because:\n- `depth_weight_deep: 0.20` penalizes nested crate files\n- But `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` also gets treated as \"deep\" despite being distractor noise\n- Depth interpretation is filesystem-literal, not semantic\n\n**The Missing Signal:**\nWe need **path-prefix affinity** - files sharing path prefixes should boost each other independent of symbol graph edges.\n\nCurrent `focus_max_hops: 2.2` and `focus_decay: 0.16` operate on symbol graph hops. But `defs.rs → doc/man.rs` may have NO symbol edges despite being logically adjacent.\n\n**Parameter Interaction Problem:**\n- Low `pagerank_alpha: 0.186` localizes PR, but PR flows through SYMBOL edges\n- High `boost_focus_expansion: 1.71` amplifies focus, but focus ALSO follows symbol edges\n- Neither captures: \"these files are in the same directory structure\"\n\n**Proposed Direction:**\nSince we can't add new signals (path-prefix), we must:\n1. **Dramatically increase depth_weight_deep** to stop penalizing nested crate structure\n2. **Reduce temporal/generic boosts** that let distractors win\n3. **Increase focus_max_hops significantly** to allow reaching through longer paths\n\nThe key insight: `focus_max_hops: 2.2` is woefully insufficient for `defs.rs → doc/man.rs` which may require 4+ symbol hops even if logically adjacent.",

Looking at what's winning:\n- `src/core/internal/deep_*.rs` - deep files winning despite depth penalties\n- `src/distractor_*.rs` - explicitly named distractors\n- `src/utils/helper_*.rs` - generic helpers\n- `tests/test_*.rs` - generic tests beating specific ones\n\nWhat's losing:\n- `crates/ignore/src/dir.rs` - should win from `tests/regression.rs`\n- `tests/binary.rs`, `tests/regression.rs` - should win from `crates/core/flags/defs.rs`\n- `crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs` - shares 4 path components with seed!\n\n**Key Insight from Key Insights:**\n> \"Path-prefix locality is a critical missing signal - defs.rs and doc/man.rs share 3 path components but system has no way to express this\"\n\nThis is the smoking gun. The system lacks path-prefix affinity. But since we can't add new parameters, we need to work with what we have.\n\n**What CAN express path locality?**\n- `focus_max_hops` - only 2.2, very limited expansion\n- `focus_decay` - 0.16 is quite aggressive decay\n- `boost_focus_expansion` - 1.71, fairly modest\n\nThe distractors are winning because they have high symbol connectivity (PageRank) but low semantic relevance. With alpha at 0.186 (very local), PageRank should be clamped. But `pagerank_chat_multiplier` at 49 is HUGE - it's amplifying the distractor PageRank signal 49x.\n\n**The Interaction:**\n- Low alpha (0.186) + high chat_multiplier (49) = local topology magnified massively\n- The distractors have high local connectivity (they were designed to)\n- Real targets have lower connectivity but higher logical relevance\n\n**Proposed Direction:**\nReduce `pagerank_chat_multiplier` drastically - the PageRank signal is poison for this dataset. Simultaneously boost `focus_expansion` to let the focus signal dominate, and increase `boost_mentioned_file` since the seed file path components should matter more.",

Deep_7, test_9, helper_1 appearing instead. The util.rs → tests/regression.rs connection is likely via *test imports* or *similar change patterns*, not PageRank centrality.\n\n2. **Failure 2** (binary.rs → flags/defs.rs + regression.rs): NDCG 0.479. Gets regression.rs at rank 3, but flags/defs.rs is nowhere. The test file should link to the flags it's testing.\n\n3. **Failure 3** (flags/defs.rs → man.rs): NDCG 0.000. Complete failure. distractor_* files dominate. The crates/core/flags/defs.rs → crates/core/flags/doc/man.rs connection is **path-prefix locality** - they share `crates/core/flags/` path. This signal is entirely absent.\n\n**Key insight**: The distractors win because they have high *symbol connectivity* (they import/export heavily). The legitimate connections are:\n- **Path co-location** (defs.rs ↔ doc/man.rs share flags/ prefix)\n- **Test-to-source imports** (binary.rs imports flags/defs.rs)\n- **Git co-change patterns** (util.rs and regression.rs probably change together)\n\nThe current system has no path-prefix scoring. Focus propagation tries to approximate this but fails against high-connectivity distractors.\n\n**The orthogonal move needed**: Since we can't add new signal types, we must:\n1. **Crush PageRank further** - chat_multiplier is still 49x, allowing distractor connectivity to dominate\n2. **Maximize temporal coupling** - if defs.rs and man.rs change together, git signals should surface this\n3. **Extend focus reach aggressively** - focus_max_hops at 2.2 may not reach doc/man.rs from defs.rs\n\nThe plateau suggests we've exhausted gradual tuning. Time for a more aggressive rebalancing.\n\n**Proposed strategy**: \"Starve distractors completely: near-zero PageRank weight, max temporal/focus, let git co-change dominate\"\n\n```json",
